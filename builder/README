What's in?
----------
This project contains necessary files and scripts to build Tungsten
Replicator.  As long as you have JKD 1.6 and Ant 1.7 or greater you
should be able to build.

What to do?
-----------
If you need to override any default, don't touch config: use
config.local instead. You can override values in there, like if you
need to build without checkout, or don't want to recompile everything.
Then, run

$ ./build.sh

Note that config.local will override defaults declared in config.  

How does it work?
-----------------
The build.sh script will:
1. Check out code for all Tungsten Replicator projects. 
2. Build all projects. 
3. Copy code to the build directory. 
4. Build the source and binary tar distributions. 

At the end of the build you will find .tar.gz output in the build
directory.

Working with Eclipse
--------------------
We normally use Eclipse for work on Tungsten.  Here's how to set up. 
1. Run build.sh to get the source code from SVN.  
2. Create a new eclipse workspace. 
3. Import this project plus all 

Depending on your Eclipse settings you may have to set the JDK
version to 1.6.
