Tungsten uses witness hosts to ensure that individual nodes are
still on the network.  If Tungsten cannot see other members of the
cluster or the witness hosts, it will automatically shut down the
node.  Enter a list of one or more hosts like routers or DNS servers
that you expect will be visible at all times to all hosts in the
cluster.
