The manager sends notifications to all routers for the purposes
of supporting 'smart scale' and for router liveness checking.
On heavily loaded systems, these notification can time out
unnecessarily. If you see 'timed out while delivering router notification'
in your manager log, try increasing the value for the timeout.

You can also turn notifications off to reduce overhead, but it's not
recommended.
