Tungsten for MySQL needs a copy of the MySQL Connector/J JDBC driver
version 5.1.13 or later to access your database servers. If you
have not done so already, you can download the latest driver from
this URL:

   http://www.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/

We recommend that you place the downloaded driver in /opt/mysql/connectorJ,
but you are welcome to place it in any convenient location.
