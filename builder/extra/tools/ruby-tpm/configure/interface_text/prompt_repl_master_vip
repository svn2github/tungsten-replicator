Tungsten can maintain an optional virtual IP address (VIP) that is
attached to the master data source and moves automatically if the
master shifts to another host.  If you are building a DR site, you
must enable a VIP on both sites so that replicators can find the master
on the primary.  Also, in the case where you will maintain a DR site,
the VIP should be a different address on each site.
