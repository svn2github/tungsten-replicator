                          Custom Backup Sample

1 Overview

This directory contains a sample custom backup script.  You can use this
script with the ScriptDumpAgent class provided as a backup agent in the 
default Tungsten Replicator implementation.  

The custom-replicator.sh script illustrates how to construct a custom
script.  It uses mysqldump and mysql to run backup and restore, respectively.

2 Getting Started

Before running make sure that the script is executable.  Also, you will 
need to set the correct database login and password. 

3 Usage

Configure the script backup in replicator.properties, then restart the 
replicator.  Here is typical usage. 
 
  trepsvc restart
  trepctl backup -backup script
  trepctl restore
