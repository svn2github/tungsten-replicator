These scripts are an example of the operations needed to start provisioning an Oracle server from a MySQL master.
The scripts in this directory pertain to the tasks needed on the MySQL side.

Before you run the scripts:

1) install MySQL Sandbox
   sudo su -
   yum -y install make perl-ExtUtils-MakeMaker perl-Test-Base.noarch
   # You must make sure that 'make' and some basic perl modules are are installed
   cpan 
   # when asked if you want to do things automatically, say 'yes'
   cpan> install MySQL::Sandbox
   cpan> exit

2) Get the binary tarball for the version of MySQL running in the main server
   wget http://www.percona.com/redir/downloads/Percona-Server-5.5/LATEST/binary/linux/x86_64/Percona-Server-5.5.30-rel30.2-500.Linux.x86_64.tar.gz

3) prepare the sandbox for installation and make sure that the server starts:
   make_sandbox --export_binaries Percona-Server-5.5.30-rel30.2-500.Linux.x86_64.tar.gz

4) remove the test installation
   sbtool -o delete -s $HOME/sandboxes/msb_5_5_30

5) Carefully edit the defaults in these scripts, to match your environment.
