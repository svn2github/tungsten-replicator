# CSV format:
#
# originalSchema,originalTable,originalColumn,newSchema,newTable,newColumn
#
# Left side (first three columns) may contain a special character:
#
# * - match all [schemas/tables/columns] (part-string matching not supported)
#
# Right side (last three columns) may contain a special character:
#
# - - leave as original

# In case of multiple entries matching the same request, order of preference is
# important. Consider the following example:
#
# schemac,*,*,schemac1,-,-
# schemac,tablew,*,schemac2,-,-
# 
# In this example all tables are moved to "schemac1" except "tablew", which is
# moved to "schemac2". Here's the rules being followed:
#
# Order of preference when looking up schema name:
#
# 1. schema.table
# 2. schema.*
#
# Order of preference when looking up table name:
#
# 1. schema.table
# 2. *.table
#
# Order of preference when looking up column name:
#
# 1. schema.table
# 2. schema.*
# 3. *.table
# 4. *.*
#
# By the way, order of preference is fixed in order to have a fast lookup.

# Notes:
#
# * Case sensitivity matters. If it is required to ignore case, use another
#   filter in the pipeline before to transform case.
#
# * For renaming columns, make sure to have column names in THL events. For
#   some DBMS types a separate filter (eg. ColumnNameFilter) might be needed.
