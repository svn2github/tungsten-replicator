Transforms Oracle table definition (DDL) to MySQL dialect. Reports errors
(ERROR) and warnings (WARN). Schema and table names are converted to lower
case.
                    
Optional includes:

  "<schema>.<table>.pk" - included when table doesn't have a primary key
                    to allow defining primary keys on the slave only.
                    CAUTION: must be used with severe care and only with
                    full understanding what problems might arise from
                    having PK on the slave only.
                    
  "<schema>.<table>.ddl" - included after all the original columns. Can
                    be used to add additional columns, indexes, constraints
                    and so on, also just comments.
