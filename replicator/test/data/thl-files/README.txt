Sample THL Logs

This directory contains THL files used for unit tests to ensure old
logs are upward compatible with new log versions.  Logs are stored
in separate directories named for the replicator version to which they belong.
To create a new log directory for a replicator version, do the following: 

1.) Install the replicator in a MySQL master/slave configuration. This will
create a log with a single heartbeat. 

2.) Execute the mysql_all_thl_types.sql script as shown in the following
example on the master: 

  # Remove csv file generated by SELECT INTO OUTFILE. 
  sudo rm /tmp/all_mysql_types.csv
  mysql -uroot < mysql_all_thl_types.sql

3.) Copy the logs into a directory named after the replicator version. 

4.) Add a Junit test case to read the log.  Test cases are located in class
com.continuent.tungsten.replicator.thl.log.DiskLogCompabilityTest.
