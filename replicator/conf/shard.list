# SHARD MAP FILE.  
# This file contains shard handling rules used in the ShardListPartitioner 
# class for parallel replication.  If unchanged shards will be hashed across
# available partitions. 

# You can assign shards explicitly using a shard name match, where the form
# is <db>=<partition>.  
#common1=0
#common2=0
#db1=1
#db2=2
#db3=3

# Default partition for shards that do not match explicit name. 
# Permissible values are either a partition number or -1, in which 
# case values are hashed across available partitions.  (-1 is the 
# default. 
#(*)=-1

# Comma-separated list of shards that require critical section to run. 
# A "critical section" means that these events are single-threaded to 
# ensure that all dependencies are met. 
#(critical)=common1,common2
