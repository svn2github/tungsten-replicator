 * Denotes a generic data source that a replicator may connect at either end of

 * <ul>
 * <li>Replicator catalogs, which consist of a set of "tables" that hold
 * metadata used to control replication. Data sources may implement such tables
 * using relational tables, files, or any other suitable means.</li>
 * <li>Connection manager, which parcels out connections to the data source, be
 * this a JDBC connection, a MongoDB connection, a connection to HDFS, etc.</li>

 * Data sources do not implement the ReplicatorPlugin lifecycle or access the
 * PluginContext implementation as this introduces dependencies that prevent
 * easy testing and hurt portability between store types.
