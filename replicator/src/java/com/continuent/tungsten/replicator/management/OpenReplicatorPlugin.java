/**
 * Replicator management plug-in definition. This interface defines basic
 * functions of a plug-in service that manages the overall replication service.
 * OpenReplicatorPlugin instances have the following life-cycle:
 * <ol>
 * <li>Instantiate from class name</li>
 * <li>Call setters on plug-in instance to load values from global property file
 * </li>
 * <li>Call prepare() to set event dispatcher and allocate resources used by
 * instance</li>
 * <li>(Calls to administrative methods)</li>
 * <li>Call release() to free resources</li>
 * </ol>
 * The default implementation of this interface controls the Tungsten native
 * replicator.

 * <strong>NOTE:</strong>This interface should not be confused with the
 * {@link com.continuent.tungsten.replicator.management.tungsten.TungstenPlugin}
 * interface, which is a plugin within the native Tungsten replicator.
