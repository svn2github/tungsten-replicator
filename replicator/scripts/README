1. Update configure file setupCDC.conf

This requires the following properties to be updated :

sys_user		->	oracle user that can connectas sysdba
					leave it empty if you can connect as '/ as sysdba'
				
source_user		->	user which owns tables that needs to get replicated

pub_user		->	user that will publish change data to tungsten

pub_password	->	publisher password

tungsten_user	->	user used by tungsten to fetch change data (aka CDC subscriber)

tungsten_pwd	->	tungsten user password

2. Run setupCDC.sh

Before running this script, you should create a tablespace for publisher.
Here is an example how it can be done:

CREATE TABLESPACE "GRANITT_PUB" DATAFILE '/oracle/GRANITT_PUB' SIZE 10485760 AUTOEXTEND ON NEXT 1048576 MAXSIZE 32767M NOLOGGING ONLINE PERMANENT BLOCKSIZE 8192 EXTENT MANAGEMENT LOCAL AUTOALLOCATE DEFAULT NOCOMPRESS SEGMENT SPACE MANAGEMENT AUTO;

3. Changing source_user

In case you need to change the source_user after setupCDC.sh was already
setup, execute the tools/cleanup.sql script. Otherwise, you might get an
error similar to this:

ORA-31411: change set TUNGSTEN_CHANGE_SET is referenced by a change table
