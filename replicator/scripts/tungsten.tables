# each table name on a new line. For each table, a list of columns to be captured can be specified.
# The format of one row is then :
# tableName<TAB>column1,...,columnN
# If this file is left empty, all the tables found in the schema will be replicated.
# If no columns are specified, every columns for the table will be captured.
